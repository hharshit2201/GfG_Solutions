Q. An array is bitonic if it is comprises of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers.
Given such a array, you need to find a element X in it and print its index.
In case, X does not exist in the array print "OOPS! NOT FOUND" without quotes.
Note: It is guaranteed that array consist of distinct elements. And array indexing is from 0.

Input:
First line will consist  a number T, the number of test cases.
Each test case will then consist of two numbers N and X. N being the array size and X being the element to be searched for.
Next line will consist of N space separated integers.


Output:
Print the required answer on separate lines.
 

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=200
-100<=A[i]<=100
 

Example:
Input:
1
5 2
1 2 7 4 3
Output:
1
